# Cert Maker 5000

So this project was created becasue I had a client that requested something similar.

However, I felt that the product I made her could be expanded on and created to be more dynamic

So this product was born!

As for the naming of the product. I wanted to bring back some nostalgia and name things like many companies did in the 90s. With some large number (typically 2000) due to Y2K.

Ok, so that's the background let's get into the nitty gritty. 


## License
This product is licensed under MIT. Which means "do whatever you want with my stuff, just don't sue me."

## General Public

### Installation
If you're just trying to get this software installed. Then you need to head over to "[Releases](https://github.com/xmikedanielsx/Cert-Maker-5000/releases)" and grab yourself the lastest copy there by downloadin the zip file, extracting it and use the setup.exe file.

### Updates
As for updates, this is a Click Once style application. As I update the software and determine that's worth of a release I will publish the updated files and your application will automatically ask you to install the update. 

#### Want to update sooner?
If you want to update sooner. No matter if I determine it's worth a full public update each time a PR is accepted and/or a new commit is made publicly a new "Release" will be published on GitHub. You can then download this zip file and do the same thing like if you were to install it without having the software. The software will realize that you already have it installed and simply update your application.


## Developers
If you're a developer and you're trying to assist or make the software better, first of .,. thank you. 

Secondly, this repo will be maintained the best I can. Please create an issue regards to the the issue you found or an enhancement you wish to create. 

I Do not want to waste your time or mine. So:
<ins>__PLEASE DO NOT START WORKIKNG ON THE ISSUE IF IT HAS NOT BEEN ACCEPTED__ . </ins>

Once you have an accepted issue/bug or enhancement please feel freet to fork, create branch and a PR and it will be reviewed then merged if passes. 

## Road Map

### Multi Language Support
Having an international family myself, I am highly motivated to get the software to be Multi Lingual. However this requires quite a bit of time and also native speakers for each language. Google Translate and other services out there are great but nothing beats a native speaker. So with that being said!. The first language I will be translating the software into will be Russian. I will announce this in one of the releases. Once this has been done, I will be open to assistance and PRs to translate the software to other languages. TIA!

### DB Storage
I plan on using ORM (Entity Framwork) to start storing priro data. The ORM support will extend to Sqlite (for those small companies who can't be bothered setting up and RDBMS but have file shares), MSSQL, PostgreSQL and MySQL.

### Event Management
While I understand this software is great for one off certificates for a list of recipients.  I do want to say that being able to manage your events and pull up old events is a huge advantage.
